Solution Implemented: Assistive Shoes
Methodology
The solution involves enhancing a regular pair of shoes with specialized components for obstacle detection and guidance. The components include ultrasonic sensors, buzzers, and an ESP8266 microprocessor for real-time processing.

Components
Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04): Three sensors are strategically placed on the shoes to detect obstacles by measuring the distance from surrounding objects. When the sensors emit ultrasonic waves, they calculate the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, thereby determining the object's proximity.
ESP8266 Microcontroller: Receives signals from the ultrasonic sensors, calculates the distance from detected obstacles, and compares it with a predetermined reference distance. If the calculated distance deviates beyond a specified tolerance range, indicating the presence of an obstacle, the microprocessor activates the buzzers to produce sound alerts.
Buzzers: Provide auditory feedback indicating the presence and direction of obstacles. If an obstacle is detected on the side, the microprocessor triggers the buzzer to provide directional feedback by utilizing different pitches, guiding the user to navigate away from the obstacle.
Hardware Integration
Successfully integrated ultrasonic sensors, ESP8266 microcontroller, and buzzers into a cohesive system, providing real-time obstacle detection and feedback.

Software Development
Developed firmware using the Arduino IDE, implementing sensor data acquisition, and buzzer control logic for obstacle alerting.

Working Principle
Obstacle Detection: The ultrasonic sensors emit ultrasonic waves and measure the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from obstacles.
Data Processing: The ESP8266 microcontroller processes the signals from the sensors, calculates the distance to obstacles, and determines if they are within a critical range.
Auditory Feedback: When an obstacle is detected, the microcontroller activates the buzzers. Different pitches and patterns of sound indicate the direction and proximity of the obstacle, guiding the user to navigate safely.
